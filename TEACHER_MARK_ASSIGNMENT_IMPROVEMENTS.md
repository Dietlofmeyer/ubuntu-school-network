## üîß Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Install New Components

1. **Enhanced Mark Modal**

   ```typescript
   import EnhancedAddMarkModal from "./subcomponents/modals/EnhancedAddMarkModal";
   ```

2. **Enhanced Bulk Modal**

   ```typescript
   import EnhancedBulkMarkModal from "./subcomponents/modals/EnhancedBulkMarkModal";
   ```

3. **Template Manager**

   ```typescript
   import MarkTemplateManager from "./subcomponents/components/MarkTemplateManager";
   ```

4. **Analytics Dashboard**
   ```typescript
   import MarkAnalytics from "./subcomponents/components/MarkAnalytics";
   ```

### Step 2: Database Schema Updates

**New Collections:**

1. **markTemplates**
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     category: string; // test, quiz, assignment, etc.
     total: number;
     description: string;
     subject?: string;
     teacherId: string;
     createdAt: string;
     isGlobal?: boolean;
   }
   ```

**Enhanced Mark Object:**

```typescript
{
  subject: string;
  score: number;
  total: number;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  teacher: string;
  category?: string; // NEW FIELD
}
```

### Step 3: Integration with Existing TeacherDash

**Replace existing modals in TeacherDash.tsx:**

```typescript
// Replace AddMarkModal with EnhancedAddMarkModal
<EnhancedAddMarkModal
  open={!!markStudent}
  onClose={handleCloseMark}
  student={markStudent}
  subject={markSubject}
  setSubject={setMarkSubject}
  score={markScore}
  setScore={setMarkScore}
  total={markTotal}
  setTotal={setMarkTotal}
  description={markDesc}
  setDescription={setMarkDesc}
  onSubmit={handleSubmitMark}
  loading={markLoading}
  t={t}
  availableSubjects={teacher?.subjects || []}
  recentMarks={getRecentMarks(markStudent, markSubject)} // NEW
  markTemplates={markTemplates} // NEW
/>

// Replace BulkMarkModal with EnhancedBulkMarkModal
<EnhancedBulkMarkModal
  open={bulkMarkOpen}
  onClose={() => setBulkMarkOpen(false)}
  subject={bulkMarkSubject}
  scores={bulkMarkScores}
  setScore={handleBulkMarkScoreChange}
  description={bulkMarkDescription}
  setDescription={setBulkMarkDescription}
  total={bulkMarkTotal}
  setTotal={setBulkMarkTotal}
  onSubmit={handleSubmitBulkMarks}
  loading={bulkMarkLoading}
  t={t}
/>
```

### Step 4: Navigation Updates

**Add new navigation items to teacher dashboard:**

```typescript
const menuItems = [
  { key: "dashboard", label: t("dashboard"), icon: "üè†" },
  { key: "marks", label: t("marks"), icon: "üìù" },
  { key: "templates", label: t("mark_templates"), icon: "üìã" }, // NEW
  { key: "analytics", label: t("mark_analytics"), icon: "üìä" }, // NEW
  { key: "students", label: t("students"), icon: "üë•" },
];
```

### Step 5: Required Translation Keys

**Add to en.json and af.json:**

```json
